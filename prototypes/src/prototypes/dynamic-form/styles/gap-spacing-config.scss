   HYBRID GAP + MARGIN SPACING CONFIGURATION
   Used exclusively by Slide2.vue for spacing experiments

   OVERVIEW:
   This file configures a hybrid spacing system that combines:
   - Flexbox GAP for container spacing (between sibling elements)
   - MARGIN for heading spacing (margin-bottom to content, margin-top when not first-child)

   WHY THIS APPROACH:
   After experimenting with a pure gap-based system using wrapper divs,
   we reverted to this simpler hybrid approach because:
   - No wrapper divs needed (~60 fewer divs in the template!)
   - More semantic HTML structure
   - Easier to maintain and reason about
   - Same visual result with less complexity

   HOW IT WORKS:
   1. Containers (SmFormGroup, conditional sections, etc.) use flexbox with gap
   2. Headings get margin-bottom for space to their content
   3. Headings get margin-top (when :not(:first-child)) for space from previous content
   4. Conditional sections get extra margin-bottom for breathing room

   SPACING EXAMPLE:
   - Between form groups: $gap-level-0-body (40px)
   - Between items in a form group: $gap-level-1-body (16px)
   - Heading to its content: $margin-level-1-heading (8px) via margin-bottom
   - After conditional content: $margin-level-2-heading (8px) extra margin-bottom

   IMPORTANT NOTES:
   - Slide1.vue is UNTOUCHED - uses original SUI spacing
   - Slide2.vue is the experimental playground for this approach
   - All user agent heading styles are reset (font-size, font-weight, line-height, margin)
   - Typography hierarchy comes purely from .form-heading-* classes

   COMPONENT OVERRIDES REQUIRED IN SLIDE2.VUE:
   To make this hybrid spacing system work, the following native/SUI component
   spacing had to be removed:

   1. All heading elements (h1-h6):
      - margin: 0 !important (removes user agent margins)
      - padding: 0 !important
      - font properties set to inherit (so .form-heading-* classes control styling)

   2. Form input components (.sm-input, .sm-select, .sm-textarea):
      - margin-top: 0 !important
      - margin-bottom: 0 !important
      - First/last child internal margins also removed

   3. Checkbox and radio components (.sm-checkbox, .sm-radio, .sm-radio-group):
      - margin-top: 0 !important
      - margin-bottom: 0 !important
      - First/last child internal margins also removed

   4. Field labels (.sm-field-label):
      - padding-top: 0 !important (creates hard top edge for consistent gap spacing)

   5. All container elements and children:
      - Form containers: .sm-form-group, .derived-rate-fields, .conditional-form-section, etc.
      - Form utilities: .form-row, .form-col, .selling-points-list, etc.
      - All set to margin: 0 !important, padding: 0 !important

   SPECIAL RULES:
   - Consecutive headings: Adjacent sibling selectors remove margin-top when
     heading immediately follows another heading (prevents triple spacing)
   - Conditional sections: Get extra margin-bottom for breathing room mid-form

$gap-level-0-body: 40px;

// Level 1: SmFormGroup (heading to body, and between body items)
$margin-level-1-heading: 8px;  // Margin on heading (bottom always, top when not first-child)
$gap-level-1-body: 16px;        // Gap between items in body

// Level 2: Subsections (heading to body, and between body items)
$margin-level-2-heading: 8px;
$gap-level-2-body: 8px;

// Level 3: Sub-subsections (heading to body, and between body items)
$margin-level-3-heading: 8px;
$gap-level-3-body: 8px;

// Level 4: Minor sections (heading to body, and between body items)
$margin-level-4-heading: 8px;
$gap-level-4-body: 8px;
